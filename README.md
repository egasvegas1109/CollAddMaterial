# CollAddMaterial by texture name
CollAddMaterial is a script for 3Ds Max that allows you to overlay GTA SA collision materials on models.

* **Support for multi and single materials:** the ability to work with multimaterials and single.
* **Mass overlay of materials:** the script allows you to apply materials to several models at once.
* **Adjustable amount of materials:** support for overlapping multiple materials at once (up to 4).
* **Saving settings:** the statuses of materials and textures will be saved.

## Installation
Download and move the "CollAddMaterial" folder to the folder "Autodesk\3ds Max 20**\scripts" **and to import models with materials, you need to install** [KAM's GTA Scripts](https://gtaforums.com/topic/907323-rel-kams-gta-scripts-2018-upd-31052020/)

## How to use
* **Import the model:**

Use KAM's GTA Scripts to import a model **with the conversion of materials to standard ones**, the texture format is not important.
